Although srumtologi C serum 22 was designed from the ground up to compete with any vitamin C serum on the market, including the two you mentioned, we use a different form of vitamin C than the L-ascorbic acid utilized by Skinceuticals or Obagi. L-ascorbic acid has very solid clinical research supporting its use in topical skincare products however it is inherently unstable and can easily become pro-oxidant. When this happens the serum can turn from clear to yellow, tan or brown. Some manufacturers color their solutions orange to hide what's going on. To avoid this we chose sodium ascorbyl phosphate as the vitamin c in our product. Adding a phosphate to ascorbic acid more than doubles the level it can survive in. L-Ascorbic acid is quite acidic with a natural pH of around 3.5. This acidity can often cause irritation to the skin. Our formulation is more alkaline and is standardized at a pH of 8.9-9.1. I hope this helps. We appreciate your interest in our groundbreaking serum. srumtologi Customer Care",1401865200.0

You can apply this on wet or dry hair and you want to make for sure that you totally cover each strand with the mixture. I put this on my hair and let it sit for about an hour or so after which I keep rinsing to make for sure it is all out. No matter how much you rinse it seems not to completely come out so I shampoo my hair after the rinse and than I will use a hair conditioner on my hair for some minutes.

Wash before and put vitamin C serum on after?i'm very confused,,"Thank you for your question. Roll the derma roller in different directions on the skin---four rolls vertically, horizontally and both diagonals should be sufficient enough to ensure desired results and stimulate collagen formation in the skin. Do not press too hard, but apply a significant amount of pressure. If you use your derma roller without the topicaine gel, less pressure should be applied. Cleansing after treatment is an important step. Wash the area with cold water, and dry gently with a clean washcloth. Apply a quality moisturizer or lotion, preferably with vitamins C and E for best results. If you've used the topicaine gel during your treatment, use an antibacterial cream followed by a quality moisturizer. Rinse the derma roller under hot water, then let it air dry and store it in a clean, dry place. Disinfect the roller after every four to five uses by standing it in a glass of rubbing alcohol for one minute. You may use the 0.2 and 0.25 mm needle lengths daily for better skin care products absorption. These short needles will not promote new collagen building, but will help you benefit more from your skin care by helping them to absorb better. Do you want to reduce the appearance of fine lines, wrinkles, scars, stretch marks, acne scars or any other similar concern treated by skin needling? Then you probably use a derma roller with needles atleast 0.5 mm or even longer. Longer needle size derma rollers help to stimulate the new collagen building and skin renewal process. As the collagen synthesis in your skin is entirely natural process. Do not disturb it by using the derma roller too often, be patient and use derma roller about once every 4-6 weeks. Sometimes after needling, your skin may turn red, similar like when sunburned, feel sensitive or slightly swollen after few hours of the treatment. It is quite normal. Keep your treated skin well moisturized and avoid direct sunlight without quality sunscreen. You may also notice some peeling after few days, moisturize your skin and don't let it dry. Apply quality skin care solutions that include Vitamins A, C and E so your skin could benefit most of them to support the new collagen synthesis in your skin. I hope it help a bid ?? 0.2-0.25 mm dermaroller may be used daily or every other day. This size improves the absorption of applied skin care products. 0.5 mm dermaroller may be used once every 3 weeks. 0.75 mm dermaroller may be used once every 4 weeks. 1.0 mm dermaroller may be used once a month (every 5-6 weeks)., 1.5 mm dermaroller may be used once every 6 weeks. 2.0-2.5 mm dermaroller may be used once every 8 weeks.",1415001600.0

Thanks!,,"You should leave the perm on your hair according to the directions. If you don't have the directions, which i'm assuming is the reason for your question, you don't want to leave the perm in your hair any longer than 20 minutes according to your hair type. Please make sure you have not washed or scratched your hair or scalp as this does not help the process and can cause abrasions or scars in the scalp. If you have washed your hair, I would wait at least a day or two for best results. If you have sensitive skin you may want to leave the perm in a shorter period of time. 15 or 20 minutes is pretty good. You also want to make sure that you start around the edges of your hair line first and work your way through the rest of your hair, making sure to part your hair in sections. 4 sections is best, it will help you to go through your hair quickly. Don't use the product directly in your scalp at first. Apply the product to the edges of all your hair first and then, if your scalp is not burning apply the rest of the product to the scalp as you go back through your hair to apply the rest of the product. Make sure to use gloves for skin protection and vaseline if you have it or the clear jelly that sometimes comes with the product. Apply the clear jelly or vaseline around the entire edges of your hairline. Example: if you have vaseline it will work fine, just take a medium helping and spread it on your face at the hairline and around the ears incase product gets onto the skin. this will keep you from burning the skin with the product. I hope this helps and I hope it wasn't too much information. I enjoy helping if I can. Good luck with straightness.",

The company will tell you that nothing has changed with the formula, however, I have multiple chemical sensitivities and can pick up on very tiny changes that maybe most of the population would not notice. The new formula also lathers more easily, so something definitely changed. However, I still do use the shampoo. After you rinse, it does not leave a fragrance on you, but you do smell it a little while you're lathering up. I can't use their conditioner anymore. The bottle smells like a mild form of windex to me and I react to it now. Their old formula was also good. I use Dessert Essense fragrance free conditioner now and love it. It also has kind of a light oatmeal smell and conditions much better than this brand (does not leave a fragrance after rinsing).

35441,open-ended,B00AOF2BZI,"Mar 17, 2014",I am African American and my natural hair is dry. What are the benefits of steaming?,,"1. To add moisture without hygral fatigue. Especially with this being Summertime and ""out"" styling is at an all time high, it is easier for elements (sun, wind, etc.) to dry out hair. To prevent unnecessary wear and tear on my tresses, I try to avoid having to restyle my hair every day. I couldn't imagine starting a fresh wash n' go, twist and curl, or satin strip braidout every day for the sake of restoring moisture. This is where steaming comes in - steam allows you to add moisture to your hair without having to start from scratch, soak your hair, or ruin your style. Because hygral fatigue wears and tears on the hair due to expanding and contracting (when soaked in water and drying), steaming is an excellent alternative without the damage. Steaming is also more effective at moisturizing than your run of the mill spray bottle, which you'll see in point #2. 2. To gently lift the cuticle for better penetration of ingredients. With the cuticle gently lifted, getting in water to moisturize (you'll still want to lightly seal) is a great benefit of steaming. Additionally, when looking to condition your hair and really get those restructurizing and replenishing ingredients in, steaming is your best bet. 3. To promote hair strength and elasticity. Whenever you add water to your hair, you are adding moisture. Whenever your hair has the proper moisture balance, you ward off dryness, brittleness, and breakage. This is especially important for transitioners, and dealing with the line of demarcation between the natural and damaged hair. 4. Steaming also enhances your natural curl pattern and promotes clumping without sacrificing volume. One of the keys to great definition (regardless of texture) is moisture. Because steaming allows you to get the moisture without dunking your head in a tub of water, you're able to walk out the door with lively and defined kinks, coils, corkscrews, and curls...and your hair isn't dripping wet. I copied this from http://blackgirllonghair.com/2013/06/4-benefits-of-hair-steaming-for-natural-hair/ I use my steamer twice a week and my hair texture and dryness have changed!",1395039600.0

Labeling is kind of a tricky thing. For instance, in Sweden, where artisan coffee is a huge thing, companies come up with their fair trade labels they mark their products with in addition to adding an organic label on it. But there is nothing that says that the whole production chain is 'fairly traded'. Same thing goes with organic cotton in clothing. It may be the case that the fabric is organic, but the dye used is extremely toxic and not organic at all. In regards to the US, I found this article that seems to point out how products get USDA certified despite having non-organic ingredients. http://www.thedailygreen.com/healthy-eating/eat-safe/3980. It unfortunately makes shopping for organic healthy products even harder when you can't trust that the labeling is 100% transparent, so as consumers we need to be even more savvy and smart in our decision making. As far as buying organic comes, I look for raw and unrefined products as much as possible, like this product seems to be. In this case I wouldn't be to bother to much about a label. I try to avoid processed anything as much as possible and am fortunate enough to live on the country side where I can trade organic foods with my neighbors. When I lived in NY, I looked for locally grown, unprocessed foods as much as possible and whenever I could go upstate, I would bring food from the local farms back to the city and throw in the freezer.

Once you start feeding your body this vitamin, your hair follicles will respond by growing. Also, You don't have to trim your hair as often either when you are trying to grow your hair. I'm excited for you to begin seeing the results that I have with the product. I continue to wear my hair short and layered, but Ann, it is so healthy and thick, it looks like a wig! Let me know how it works for you. It's a great product and be sure to drink plenty of water, massage your scalp at night, keep away from heat as much as possible (I pin curl my hair during the week with hair pins), and use organic coconut oil during styling for moisture/shine and growth. Last thing, stress will hinder your growth, so drink your tea and pray daily. God will bless you as you seek after the things He desires for your life. God bless you! -Valerie Hebrews 10:35 P.S. I also use Shea butter oil on my scalp every other day (with a pointed top) and wear a satin scarf at night when I can. Helps prevent breakage and keeps roots/scalp healthy. Wash weekly with a non-sulfur shampoo/conditioner (Design Essentials from JC Penney Salon store) and then I switch up sometimes and use the Keratin Smooth Tressame/Shmp/Cond from Walmart $3 ea. - sorry I wrote a book but knowledge is key :o)",1400050800.0

22427,open-ended,B0041LSTJ8,"Jun 29, 2014",How do you use it?,,"A toner is used on hair that has been bleached or pre-lightened in order to accept the new color (i.e.: T14) in order to cancel-out, correct or even-out the unwanted tones in your hair - brassy yellow, gold, orange, or red tones. Not knowing the health of your hair, condition, current color or length, I can only tell you the process to use toner: your hair will need to be bleached (maybe twice if your hair is dark) to a pale blond or even whitish color. You need bleach powder and crme developer. (In my case, to make it easier on me, and which I have used before, I used SPLAT Lightening Bleach; it is pre-measured). After bleaching, mix the T14 with 20 volume developer (use a little over two ounces of developer); and apply it to your hair. The mixture will turn a purple-blue color but don't worry it is actually neutralizing any orange tones. Leave it on for 20 minutes. Rinse, wash and condition your hair. Toner is easier on your and is not permanent; depending on your hair, it will last a few weeks. I hope this helps!! If you're looking to ""try on the silvery color"" and your hair is light blonde, I would suggest a purple shampoo. I've done a write-up, here on Amazon, for Pravana Pure Light Sulfate-free Brightening Shampoo for Blonde Silver or Highlighted Hair.

Because under normal circumstances out skin needs time to heal and grab ahold of what we've done, rushing is not advised. I use my derma roller once a week and each time I use I apply alittle more pressure. It takes 30 days at least for your collagen to to be encouraged. Then after you have it to were your adjusting to the roller in corporate your red LED. If we rush the skin with too much too fast we won't receive any benefit. So this why I say to move slowly.

So basically: 1) Go through your basic skin care routine. 2) Do I have to use alcohol or witch hazel to remove excess oil?,,"Jonathan, just started using this and from what I'd read on different reviews, this is what I do. I clean my face with witch hazel thoroughly, then I rinse it off with water. I wasnt sure if acid will react to witch hazel. I apply the acid, starting on my forehead or cheeks first. I made the mistake of doing it near my nose at first and it pooled on the crease and boy did that hurt! Also when applying near the nose/mouth area, hold your breath and make sure you have good ventilation. I think I was hyperventilating on the first application because Im a sissy with pain and I can feel it stinging a little in my nose and mouth when I was breathing thru my mouth. Definitely do something distracting while waiting for the 5 minutes. I walked around really fast around the house to distract me. The first 3 mins is definitely tough. The more you use it the better it gets. Then rinse with a lot of water. Water is an easy enutralizer. some people use 1tbsp Baking soda/1cup water mixture. I just use the handheld showerhead. Definitely use a good moisturer after. Hope this helps.",1389600000.0

Thank you.,?,"Hi Xiaoniu, After the seller shipped the product, they sent me this message with the following instructions: INSTRUCTIONS OF USAGE When you use our derma roller for the first time, you will get it out of a vacuum packed bag and it will be sterile. 1. Choose an appropriate length of needle according to the condition of your skin. 2. Wash thouroughly your hands and face before the procedure, rub well all areas to remove bacterias. 3. Your doctor can advice you on which cream you should use before the procedure to prepare your skin. 4. For the most sensitive patients a topical numbing cream can be used. Application of cream anesthesia can prevent procedure pain and help in performing the procedure properly. 5. The rolling of Derma Roller should be meticulous and dense, the strength applied to the device should be uniform. Follow 3 steps of needling to enhance the forming of the micro-channels. You have to roll in 3 directions on each area of your face: Horizontally, vertically, and diagonal around 7 to 15 times on each movement. Don't roll twice on a previously treated area on the same session. 6. Apply a cool mask or cold packs after a Derma Roller treatment. It has the effect of easing and eliminating post-therapy redness. 7. Use of a moisturizing serum is advisable 8. Use a sun blocking cream during 7 days after the procedure. 9. Allow an interval of 4-6 weeks between the procedures to get good results. 10. Other treatments such as subcision, punch elevation may need to be combined for optimal results in acne scars. Clean the Derma roller Wash thoroughly your dermaroller unit, with water and soap. Brush away any residual debris after using it. Then soak about 5-8 minutes with 90% alcohol, or use ultraviolet to disinfect for about 45 minutes. You can also use a cold sterilizer like Clorexhidine solution. Do not use chlorine, autoclaves, steam and high temperature sterilization methods. . Cautions 1) Do not share the unit with other people 2) Do not roll too much more than indicated time. If treated skin shows hypersensitive response, consult with your doctor. 3) Keep the micro needle part always clean and dry 4)Store in a safe place out of the reach of children ALWAYS SEEK ADVICE OF A PHYSICIAN BEFORE USING THE DERMA ROLLER FOR EXACT INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO PERFORM THE THERAPY FOR YOUR UNIQUE TYPE AND CONDITION OF SKIN Please feel free to contact us with your questions.

I scrubbed my tile with Ajax; rinsed, dried, and then cleaned again with alcohol. With a clean surface you'll get a good strong bond. Position the unit to the location and height you prefer. Apply a couple of big gobs to the back of the unit and press firmly against the mounting surface. Hold in place for a minute or two.

That's a tough question because of the process that gives us those dark wrinkles in the first place. Basically, as we age (and I recommend against it! lol) the skin under our eyes, very thin to begin with, thins even more and the lower layer of blood vessels is more visible. That is the dark color we see in under-eye circles. I have tried quite a few of them, some inexplicably expensive (hundreds of $$ an ounce) and have found none that is superior to another. No cream will grow more layers of skin under your eyes, and non will bleach out the color underneath them (a bad idea anyway). The best technique here is to have great genes; some people hardly develop under-eye circles at all. But that's not something we can control. I recommend think in terms of concealing the under-eye circles. Some concealers will be of a type (powder, liquid, waxy-semi-solid, etc) that will work best with our complexion and your other make-up. Select a shade of concealer one or two shades lighter than your normal facial make-up, as the darkness of the circles will make the concealer look darker. Please don't put on a thick coat, as this will look a bit scary. Apply the concealer, lightly dab it with an edge of a make-up wedge, moving from the outside of the eye to the inside and allow your mouth to hang open while doing this application. This will help avoid stretching out the skin. If you need another light coat to cover the circles, apply a very thin layer of a facial powder containing a moisturizing ingredient -- this is dry skin! -- and again apply from the outer edges to the nose, then with the same make-up wedge lightly spread a bit down and around the lower eye to enhance the effect of the concealer being your normal skin color. Depending on your skin color, your patience and how much those circles bother you, applying a light lotion like Clarin's Flash Balm (thing -- it's yellow) which helps dull the dark color. It is not expensive, a good thing as far as I'm concerned. Also, some people have success with a very thin application of eyeliner in a color to help neutralize the dark color -- try a yellowish-orange eyeliner and put it on very sparingly, then apply the rest of your makeup. I've seen folks have great success and great failures with this technique, but life should be a surprise, I think. One last though: it's better to allow a bit of the dark circles to show through than to put a lot of make-up over them, to completely cover -- this really trades the unfortunate look of dark circles for the very unfortunate look of glops of make-up under your eyes. It all takes a bit of practice but you can do really well and not spend a great deal. Good luck!",1382857200.0

My experience is if the device is used immediately after being stung and applied continuously for 2-3 minutes, the pain is dramatically reduced, leaving only a little residual discomfort. I stopped beekeeping because I was getting successively worse reactions from the stings, but the Extractor really helped.

Anyone know what's going on?,,"I purchased this product in May and it was sold by Mid-States Beauty it was in authentic packaging and looks like pictured. This is my 3rd purchase of this product. Like you, I think there is something ""hinky"" with this product and re-sellers of the product. There is no safety packaging to prevent tampering. Mine came sealed with clear packing tape right on the bottle and no box or insert ,the tape was wrinkled and obviously not placed there at the manufacturer. I hate to say we got taken but I think this is just aloe vera gel with green food coloring added. I have used this in the past and it worked famously. Last 2 purchases just didn't do anything but soothe my skin after hair removal.It did not prevent any ingrown hairs and had no effect on the razor bumps already present. Try Bump Stopper 2 double strength. It works overnight with ingrown hairs peeking through the bump within a few hours of application and it's a lot cheaper. I know it's hard to get a refund for these purchases because most of us will give it the old college try and hope it works using it for a minimum of 6 weeks before we realize it ain't doing a thing and by that time NO REFUNDS. So to answer your question I would definitely contact the manufacturer and ask about the ""new formulation"" but I suspect it's been counterfeited based on my experience and no tamper proof packaging. Maybe Princereigns will wise up and make their product tamper proof when we stop buying it. The product is dispensed from the bottom up and it seems they make sure you can't reuse the bottle but nothing to stop someone from removing the authentic product and refilling it with ??. I hope this helps and give Bump stopper 2 a try it works and quickly. I hope this helps.",1405321200.0

My hair is quite long- it reaches my the middle of my back (horizontal bra strap ). This iron does a great job of getting all of my hair perfectly straight in about 35 min. I think the difference between choosing the smaller vs. larger iron is whether your natural hair is curly/ wavy course or if it's pretty silky to begin with. If its curly/coarse/ wavy especially at the roots I suggest the 1"" iron so you can get to the hair around the nape of your neck and around your crown and temples. The 1 1/2 "" iron is to bulky to get to those areas and you risk burning yourself. If your hair is more silky/ fine to begin with and you are only seeking to use the iron to smooth your hair and give shine, then get the 1 1/2"" iron since it will be faster to straighten because you can do larger pieces of hair at a time.

If acne scarring is a prob this peel is helpful for that. Acne is largely due to the secretion of sebum that clogs pores on the face and supports the growth of bacteria. Salicylic acid is fat soluble and goes deep into these pores to dissolve the sebum, kill bacteria and peel away layers of acne scars and blemishes. Salicylic acid peels will also remove blackheads, whiteheads and other blemishes that result from the congestion of the skin. This effective acid will peel off the dirty, discolored epidermis and provide the layer of smooth texture and the more even appearance of the dermis. As most people tolerate this peel well, the affordability of the treatment and the superior results makes it a very popular choice for people who experience acne breakouts. If you sole concern is acne then salicylic is best for you. Personally I alternate between both as I find the glycolic sheds my skin better allowing the salicylic to get deeper.

I used to have thick hair, now about 50% of it has fallen out and I can see my scalp. I want it to fill in with new hairs, but seems like then the battle is...",,"Hi Amber, I am troubled to hear about your hair loss; perhaps you have found ""Rosemary"" helpful? My experience is that pure ""Peppermint"" works best to ""fill in""/stimulate new hair growth, and continual hair growth-both with a wonderful fragrance. By no means am I suggesting that ""Rosemary"" wouldn't do the same-I simply do not know, because I have never found it necessary to try, nor would I be inclined to do so, simply do to the smell mixed with hair, even clean hair is not something that I invite. I can tell you because it is the only thing that I do and have done for years-what works for me: My hair is mildly course; thus it requires a sealant, for which I use the oil: [100% pure: Meadowfoam], which contains 98% fatty acids long-chain carbon atoms, and it is resistant to oxidation, thus it is moisturizing, and rejuvenating, and is a natural UV resistant. This I combine with [100% pure: Peppermint Oil], which is a natural circulatory and muscle stimulant. Depending upon your hair type, your carrier oil can be anything from grape seed, which I use for my nieces hair, which is extremely fine and luxuriously curly-therefore, it does not need to be weighted with a heavy oil, such as (Meadowfoam, macadamia, etc.); you will just need to study and decide, which carrier oil works best for your hair type, and what ratio of peppermint to the carrier oil you should use. For a friend of mine who was balding, we applied 100% pure peppermint oil directly to her scalp, several times daily for about three months; she began noticing an even growth of fuzz, then length, and strength to her hair that she never had previously. Thereafter, because her hair texture is also fine, she found that Peppermint and grape seed oil worked for her lengthy hair, but she also applied the blend to her scalp no longer needing just peppermint oil for the scalp. I am not suggesting that you will see the same results, I think there are other factors as with most things in life, (e.g., diet, rest, exercise) all play a part in our overall health and well-being, including things like our hair follicles. =) Nevertheless, I hope that I have at least provided you with some hope and perhaps another perspective.

I'm not having the falling out so drastic as others now, I did in...",,"Hi Kenneth, thank you so much for your question. The reason we offer a guarantee is because Provaxa may not work for a handful of people. As you'll see, we're the only hair loss vitamin manufacturer who will offer that. Many customers who had little to no results on their first purchase were using topicals that were holding the hair follicle back from getting healthy through the benefits of Provaxa. If you purchase, you'll receive a Guide to Success With Provaxa that will explain why we want customers to use a biotin shampoo only. The first step is getting hair shedding to stop which should happen between 45 and 90 days. That is 60% of the battle to restoring hair growth and a healthy follicle. During that time you will probably see existing hair thicken and other benefits. So please consider trying it knowing that we recognize it may not work for a handful of people and we are happy to refund your money. I hope that helps! Thanks, Lois",1382079600.0

25165,open-ended,B004TSFBNK,"Feb 18, 2013","If I only use creme foundation, blush and finishing powder - is this a good choice - or is the travel essentials better?",,"IMHO :) the travel essential has one for handling the eyes quickly (the violet one), a flat one for liquid foundation and concealer, and a fluffy big one for anything powder. If you don't use concealer, then your foundation brush will be used with one product alone. Then the big fluffy one would be used for powder and blush. So I guess it would just take a bit of paying attention to not still have blush on it the second time you use it, otherwise the powdering may render something weird :). Basically with 3 brushes you can cover your whole face (the eyes one may be a bit too big for precision stuff, but you can work it just fine ). The 4 brush set allows you to have separate brushes for foundation, concealer, blush and powder. And not use the same one for two products. I guess you can choose based on - how often you clean them (I'd say clean them more often if you mix two products on one) - how much product you use (i just buff a bit of powder and often use the blush one in the Core collection for blush afterwards since I only put a bit on...then I give it a good wipe on a dry cotton or something, I wash it once a week) - if you care having the tiny concealer one You'd have 3 brushes not 4, with a bit fluffy one for powders, or you could have 4 brushes for liquid and powders and a wider range of use (the detailer one is quite small and stiff for the eyes so the choice is up to you) I'm going to stop here now :) whichever the choice may be, the fluffiness is the best payoff :) If I had 0 brushes, I'd pick the travel essentials to cover all areas better I guess.",1361174400.0

Our ASBI Certified Premium Grade A Unrefined Shea Butter is 100% all natural, has passed high measures for safety, performance and shelf life and has the highest healing fraction and moisturizing fraction of any Shea Butter product or any natural skincare product available. Many people are unaware of this. As ASBI has communicated, it receives a ""Gold Medal"" in both healing and moisturizing and is for use on any skin type and on any skin on the body. Our current batch has actually been given the designation of 'Best Shea Butter In The World' by ASBI due to it's high test score during laboratory testing. All our batches score very high on the ASBI test and we make available our ASBI Grading Analysis for our batches upon request. That being said, our Shea Butter has it's greatest healing and moisturizing ability when simply used alone. By adding anything to pure Premium Grade A Shea Butter it may diminish some of the bioactive/healing properties, so we advise against doing that. For those customers of ours who are do-it-your-selfers and like to mix their Shea Butter with other things like Essential Oils, there is an ASBI approved safe and effective way to melt your Premium Grade A Shea Butter to preserve its bioactive/healing properties as best as possible (NOTE: do not heat in microwave.) We are happy to provide this to our customers upon request so that they may follow the instructions. Best results are typically seen within 4-6 week of regular use. Please stay in touch so that we may best serve you and enable you to have the best experience with our Premium Shea Butter. We'd love to be able to assist you with your unique situation as best we can. We want to make sure you are 100% happy with our product. Hopefully, this is helpful to you.

But please read on to understand what options may be better choice for you. Heres a somewhat detailed explanation and guideline to what to look for when purchasing from us or other providers of Phytoceramides. When you look around and compare different phytoceramide products, you will find different recommendations by different companies. The most ""popular"" dose seems to be 350mg for the sole reason Dr Oz recommended that. At the time of his broadcast and the sources he used at the time, they discussed wheat and gluten based dosages only, witch in summary is a very misleading or simplified recommendation. But many just promt follow that and ask for this dosage and nothing more. The most potent research we now have access to comes from another direction and continent all together - Japan. High quality Rice based Phytoceramides are superior all together, but dosages are different. In recent studies 40mg of daily rice based supplementation was more than sufficient for optimal results and performed better than phytoceramides from sweet potatoe and other sources. So that is what we have included in our supplement. Please beware that MANY companies take advantage of the ""prescribed"" 350mg dosage and use shady marketing tactics and vague description on their supplement facts tables. You get 350mg of what exactly? Even we dont really know that. Hope this helped you to see things from several perspectives. Best of luck with your purchase of Phytoceramides.

However, avoid using a face moisturizer around your eyes. The skin around the eyes is very thin and face moisturizers are too heavy for the eyes. In any event, I recommend always using an eye cream or gel. But I do not recommend this product. I had an allergic reaction to the product. Look into an eye cream (or gel) that has few chemicals or even better, one that is organic. Eye creams (or gels) with too many chemicals and preservatives will dry out the skin under the eyes...creating wrinkles. When researching skin care products that are organic, make sure that the item(s) have a seal certifying that the product is most definitely organic. Some products claim to be organic but still have harmful chemicals. Check the label and avoid products with these chemicals: parabens, phthalates, sodium lauryl sulfate, fragrance, formaldehyde and others. You can do a search for the complete list of chemicals to avoid. In closing, DO NOT purchase this product. Do your research. You may spend a little more but you won't be sorry. I hope this helps.
